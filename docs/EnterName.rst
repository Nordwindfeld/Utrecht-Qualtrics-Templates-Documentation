======================
Enter Name Template
======================

Description
------------------
The 'Enter Name' Template in Qualtrics allows participants to enter up to 20 names.
These names are saved in embedded data fields for later use in the project. The template visually displays the entered names in yellow boxes and updates a counter to show how many names have been entered.
The "Continue" button only appears once all 20 names have been entered.

Quick Overview
------------------

1. Entering Names:
    - Participants enter names into the text field and click the "Enter Name" button.
    - Alternatively, pressing the Enter key will also add a name.
    - The input field validates entries, highlighting invalid characters in red.

2. Displaying Names:
    - Entered names are displayed in yellow boxes below the input field.
    - Each box shows the name and a "[x]" to remove the name.
    - The counter below the input field indicates how many names have been entered.

3. Saving and Proceeding:
    - Names are saved in embedded data fields.
    - The "Continue" button is enabled and displayed only when exactly 20 names are entered.


Important
====================
Since the entire code is completely self-created and doesn't always use the functions of Qualtrics one hundred percent, you also need to define the data you want to save yourself.
For this, we use :ref:`embedded-data-fields`.
