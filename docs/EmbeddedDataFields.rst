Embedded Data fields - Save Customized Data
=============================================

Embedded Data Fields are user-defined data fields that can store user-defined values.
Here is how to define them yourself.

1. In the left sidebar of the survey in Qualtrics, there is a menu with several items.
The second item is 'Survey Flow'.

4. Now enter the name of your variables. In our example, we call them 'nameField' and append the numbers 1-20, so we can automatically assign them with a JavaScript code.

These user-defined variables can now be used in other questions.
